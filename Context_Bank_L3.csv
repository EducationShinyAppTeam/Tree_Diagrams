"1. Some states have recently initiated programs to randomly test high school athletes for possible use of anabolic steroids after concerns arose about the health of the athletes and fairness in the sports. Critics of the programs say that the amount of money spent on testing isn't worth it, since only 1 in 2000 high school athletes actually use steroids to enhance their performance.  The test used does have a 97.3% probability of being positive when an athlete uses steroids and a 98.4% probability of showing a negative result when an athlete is not using steroids.",Steroids,No Steroids,-,Pos,Neg,-,Pos,Neg,-,-,-,-,0.0005,0.9995,0,0.973,0.027,0,0.016,0.984,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,2,a.
